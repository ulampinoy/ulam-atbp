**Chicken Adobo** – this is the leftover adobo but more flavorful – more concentrated as a result of post-marination of the meat in its sauce.

**Spinach Laing** – a special version of the traditional laing made of taro leaves!

We've got some dried dilis (anchovies) and this time sautéed in bagoong alamang (fermented shrimp paste).
