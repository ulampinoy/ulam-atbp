    heading: About the project
    text: "We started UlamPinoy as a food journal of recipes we cooked at home and everything else was about tasty discoveries we came along the way as migrants away from home. Later on, we created the YouTube cooking channel to document these home-cooked recipes to serve primarily for the kids when they grow up."
