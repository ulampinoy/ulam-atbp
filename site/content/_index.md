    heading: About this project
    text: "We started UlamPinoy as a food journal of recipes we cooked at home and everything else was about tasty discoveries we came along the way as migrants away from home. Later on, we created the YouTube cooking channel to document these home-cooked recipes to serve primarily for the kids when they grow up."

    heading: Our values
    text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
